// Server-side proxy for paginated commit fetches, so the browser never talks
// to api.github.com directly. Unauthenticated GitHub REST calls are capped
// at 60/hour PER IP — CommitHistory used to fetch straight from the client
// on every page/page-size change, so a handful of clicks during testing (or
// any one visitor paging around) could exhaust that budget entirely, which
// surfaced as "Couldn't reach the GitHub API" even though GitHub itself was
// fine. Routing through this route instead means:
// - Next's fetch cache (see lib/github.ts) shares one real GitHub call
//   across every visitor hitting the same page/per_page combo within the
//   window, instead of each browser spending its own quota per click. Each
//   commit's diff stats are cached separately, by sha, for 30 days — they
//   can never change, so that cost is paid at most once per commit ever.
// - If GITHUB_TOKEN is ever set in the environment, authenticated requests
//   get a 5,000/hour ceiling instead of 60 — optional, not required.
